FADE IN:

EXT. A DESKTOP SCREEN - DAY

We see a 3D Blender interface on a computer screen. A user named JASON (30s) is passionately working on a 3D model of a rabbit. He has been using Blender for years and is a master at it. Suddenly, an error message pops up on his screen. He tries to fix it, but the program crashes. Jason slams his fist on the desk in frustration.

JASON
(to himself)
Ugh, not again. What's causing this?

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason is sitting on his couch, browsing the internet for solutions to his problem. He comes across a forum post by a mysterious Blender developer who claims to have the solution to all of his problems. The developer goes by the username "RabbitHole." Intrigued, Jason sends him a message asking for help.

JASON
(to himself)
This RabbitHole guy seems to know his stuff. Maybe he can help me.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason is still working on his 3D model when he receives a response from RabbitHole. The developer offers to help him, but only if he follows a set of specific instructions. Jason agrees, and RabbitHole sends him a link to a hidden section of the Blender website.

RABBIT HOLE
(via message)
Hey Jason, I think I can help you out with your Blender problem. But first, you need to follow my instructions carefully. Go to this link and enter this password: rabbit123.

JASON
(via message)
Thanks, RabbitHole. I'll check it out now.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason clicks on the link and is taken to a mysterious section of the Blender website. It's filled with secret forums, hidden tutorials, and experimental plugins. Jason is fascinated and begins to explore the site.

JASON
(to himself)
Wow, I've never seen this before. There's so much here to learn.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason spends all night exploring the Blender website, trying out new plugins and tutorials. He becomes obsessed with the possibilities of Blender and begins to neglect his personal life and job.

JASON
(to himself)
Just one more tutorial, and then I'll go to bed.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason's girlfriend, LISA (30s), comes over to his apartment to check on him. She's worried about his well-being and wants him to take a break from Blender.

LISA
(worried)
Hey Jason, I haven't seen you in a while. Are you doing okay?

JASON
(distracted)
Yeah, I'm fine. I've just been really busy with work.

LISA
(skeptical)
Work? You mean Blender, right?

JASON
(defensive)
What? No, I've been busy with work.

LISA
(sighs)
Jason, you've been neglecting everything for Blender. You need to take a break.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason's boss calls him and tells him that he's been missing work and needs to come in immediately. Jason hangs up and continues to work on his 3D model. He's become completely obsessed with Blender and can't stop.

BOSS
(via phone)
Jason, where have you been? You've been missing work for the past few days.

JASON
(distracted)
Uh, sorry boss. I'll be there soon.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason continues to work on his 3D model, completely unaware of the time. He's now deep into the RabbitHole section of the Blender website and has lost track of everything around him.

JASON
(to himself)
This is amazing. I've never felt so inspired.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason's girlfriend comes back over to his apartment to check on him. She finds him sitting in front of his computer, still working on Blender.

LISA
(angry)
Jason, what the hell? You didn't even show up to work today!

JASON
(defensive)
I'm sorry, I lost track of time. I was working on something important.

LISA
(disappointed)
You need to get your priorities straight, Jason. This isn't healthy.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason continues to work on Blender, completely ignoring everything around him. He's now experimenting with some of the experimental plugins on the RabbitHole section of the Blender website.

JASON
(to himself)
This is amazing. I can do anything with Blender.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason's boss calls him again, this time with a stern warning. He tells Jason that he needs to show up to work or he'll be fired. Jason ignores the call and continues to work on Blender.

BOSS
(via phone)
Jason, this is your last warning. If you don't show up to work today, you're fired.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason's girlfriend comes over to his apartment again, this time with a more serious tone.

LISA
(angry)
Jason, this is getting out of hand. You've been neglecting everything for Blender. You need to stop.

JASON
(defensive)
But I'm onto something great, Lisa. I can't stop now.

LISA
(sighs)
Fine, but I can't keep watching you do this to yourself. I'm leaving.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT

Jason continues to work on Blender, completely alone and isolated. He's become so obsessed with the program that he's lost touch with reality.

JASON
(to himself)
This is my life now. Blender is everything.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason's boss comes to his apartment, furious. He tells Jason that he's been fired for missing work and neglecting his duties. Jason is devastated.

BOSS
(angry)
Jason, you're fired. You've been neglecting your job for weeks now. I can't keep covering for you.

JASON
(devastated)
But, but I can fix this. I can make it right.

BOSS
(shaking his head)
It's too late, Jason. You need to get help.

CUT TO:

INT. JASON'S APARTMENT - DAY

Jason sits alone in his apartment, surrounded by his Blender work. He's lost everything because of his obsession with the program.

JASON
(to himself)
What have I done? I've lost everything because of Blender.

Suddenly, RabbitHole sends him a message.

RABBIT HOLE
(via message)
Hey Jason, sorry to hear about your troubles. But don't worry, there's a way out of the RabbitHole. You just have to find it.

Jason looks at the message, confused but intrigued.

JASON
(to himself)
A way out of the RabbitHole? What does that mean?

FADE OUT.
